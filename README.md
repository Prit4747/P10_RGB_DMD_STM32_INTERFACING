# P10_RGB_DMD_STM32_INTERFACING
Interfacing P10 RGB DMD with STM32 involves HUB75 connection (R/G/B, A/B/C, CLK, LAT, OE), 5V power, and software (DMD_STM32 library or HAL). Set pixels in framebuffer, scan rows (1/4 or 1/8 mode), shift data, latch, and PWM OE for brightness. Use DMA for speed, >60Hz refresh to avoid flicker.
